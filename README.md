# SimpleSnake
 
This is a simple Snake game in which the snake moves only when there is user input, and the goal is to get the highest score.
# Rules: 
  * lives are reduced when apple despawns
  * apple despawns after a set amount of turns
  * score increases on every valid move
  * game ends regardless of the available lives if the snake collides with itself
